## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up a basic authorization structure with Bedrock. By the end, you'll have:

- Scope types defining your organizational hierarchy
- Scopes representing your organization and teams
- Roles and permissions for access control
- Both a user and an AI agent with appropriate access

## Step 1: Define Your Scope Types

Scope types define the kinds of organizational units in your hierarchy. Common examples include organizations, teams, and projects.

```bash
# Create Organization scope type
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/scope-types' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Organization",
    "description": "Top-level organization"
  }'

# Create Team scope type
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/scope-types' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Team",
    "description": "Team within an organization"
  }'
```

Then define the hierarchy relationship:

```bash
# Teams can be children of Organizations
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/scope-type-hierarchy' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "parentTypeId": "type_org",
    "childTypeId": "type_team"
  }'
```

## Step 2: Create Scopes

Now create actual scopes representing your organization:

```bash
# Create your organization
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/scopes' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme Corp",
    "typeId": "type_org",
    "externalId": "acme-corp"
  }'

# Create a team
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/scopes' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Engineering",
    "typeId": "type_team",
    "externalId": "engineering"
  }'

# Link team to organization
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/scope-hierarchy' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "parentScopeId": "scope_acme",
    "childScopeId": "scope_engineering"
  }'
```

## Step 3: Create Roles and Permissions

Define what actions are possible and group them into roles:

```bash
# Create permissions at the org level
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/permissions' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "read:documents", "scopeId": "scope_acme"}'

curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/permissions' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "write:documents", "scopeId": "scope_acme"}'

curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/permissions' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "delete:documents", "scopeId": "scope_acme"}'

# Create roles
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/roles' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Viewer",
    "description": "Read-only access",
    "scopeId": "scope_acme"
  }'

curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/roles' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Editor",
    "description": "Can read and write",
    "scopeId": "scope_acme"
  }'

# Assign permissions to roles
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/role-permissions' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"roleId": "role_viewer", "permissionId": "perm_read"}'

curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/role-permissions' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"roleId": "role_editor", "permissionId": "perm_read"}'

curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/role-permissions' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"roleId": "role_editor", "permissionId": "perm_write"}'
```

## Step 4: Add a User

Create a user subject, add them to a scope, and assign a role:

```bash
# Create user subject
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/subjects' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "type": "user",
    "externalId": "user-jane-doe",
    "metadata": {"name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@acme.com"}
  }'

# Add user to engineering team
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/memberships' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "subjectId": "sub_jane",
    "scopeId": "scope_engineering"
  }'

# Assign Editor role
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/role-assignments' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "roleId": "role_editor",
    "membershipId": "mem_jane_eng"
  }'
```

## Step 5: Add an AI Agent

Add an AI agent with more restricted permissions:

```bash
# Create agent subject
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/subjects' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "type": "agent",
    "externalId": "coding-assistant-v1",
    "metadata": {"name": "Coding Assistant", "model": "claude-3"}
  }'

# Add agent to engineering team
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/memberships' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "subjectId": "sub_agent",
    "scopeId": "scope_engineering"
  }'

# Assign Viewer role (read-only for the agent)
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/role-assignments' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "roleId": "role_viewer",
    "membershipId": "mem_agent_eng"
  }'
```

<Check>
  You now have a user with Editor access and an AI agent with Viewer access to the Engineering team!

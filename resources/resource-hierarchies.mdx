## What are Resource Hierarchies?

**Resource hierarchies** allow you to model parent-child relationships between resources. A folder contains documents, a project contains tasks, an order contains line items. These relationships enable hierarchical permission propagation and structured queries.

## Hierarchy Edge Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `parentResourceId` | `string` | The parent resource |
| `childResourceId` | `string` | The child resource |
| `relationshipType` | `string?` | Type of relationship (e.g., "contains", "references") |
| `createdAt` | `string` | When the relationship was created |

## Creating Resource Hierarchies

```bash
# Create a folder
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/resources' \
  -d '{
    "resourceTypeId": "rtype_folder",
    "scopeId": "scope_engineering",
    "externalResourceId": "folder-123",
    "displayName": "Engineering Docs"
  }'

# Create a document
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/resources' \
  -d '{
    "resourceTypeId": "rtype_document",
    "scopeId": "scope_engineering",
    "externalResourceId": "doc-456",
    "displayName": "API Design Doc"
  }'

# Link document to folder
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/resource-hierarchy' \
  -d '{
    "parentResourceId": "resource_folder_123",
    "childResourceId": "resource_doc_456",
    "relationshipType": "contains"
  }'
```

## Resource Type Hierarchies

Before creating resource hierarchies, define which resource types can contain which:

```bash
# Folders can contain Documents
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/resource-type-hierarchy' \
  -d '{
    "parentTypeId": "rtype_folder",
    "childTypeId": "rtype_document"
  }'

# Folders can contain Folders (nested)
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/resource-type-hierarchy' \
  -d '{
    "parentTypeId": "rtype_folder",
    "childTypeId": "rtype_folder"
  }'

# Projects can contain Tasks
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/resource-type-hierarchy' \
  -d '{
    "parentTypeId": "rtype_project",
    "childTypeId": "rtype_task"
  }'
```

## Hierarchical Permission Patterns

### Pattern 1: Folder Access Grants Document Access

When a user can access a folder, they can access its contents:

```typescript
// Check if user can read the folder
const folderAccess = await bedrock.evaluate({
  actor: { subjectId: "subject_jane", subjectType: "user" },
  scopeId: "scope_engineering",
  action: "read",
  resource: { resourceId: "resource_folder_123" }
});

// If folder access granted, documents inside are also accessible
if (folderAccess.allowed) {
  // User can read documents in this folder
}
```

### Pattern 2: Inherited Permissions

Define permissions that propagate through the hierarchy:

```bash
# Permission to read folder and all contents
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/permissions' \
  -d '{
    "scopeId": "scope_org",
    "action": "read",
    "resourceType": "folder",
    "resourcePattern": "*",
    "key": "folder:read:*",
    "label": "Read Folder and Contents",
    "logic": {
      "or": [
        {"==": [{"var": "resource.type"}, "folder"]},
        {"in": [{"var": "resource.parentId"}, {"var": "subject.accessibleFolders"}]}
      ]
    }
  }'
```

## Common Hierarchy Patterns

### Document Management

```
Workspace
└── Folder
    ├── Document
    │   └── Comment
    └── Folder (nested)
        └── Document
```

```bash
# Define type hierarchy
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/resource-type-hierarchy/batch' \
  -d '[
    {"parentTypeId": "rtype_workspace", "childTypeId": "rtype_folder"},
    {"parentTypeId": "rtype_folder", "childTypeId": "rtype_folder"},
    {"parentTypeId": "rtype_folder", "childTypeId": "rtype_document"},
    {"parentTypeId": "rtype_document", "childTypeId": "rtype_comment"}
  ]'
```

### Project Management

```
Project
├── Epic
│   └── Issue
│       └── Subtask
└── Sprint
    └── Issue (linked)
```

### E-Commerce

```
Store
└── Category
    └── Product
        ├── Variant
        └── Review
```

### Construction

```
Job Site
├── Work Order
│   └── Task
└── Daily Log
    └── Entry
```

## Querying Hierarchies

```bash
# Get children of a resource
curl -X GET 'https://api.example.com/resources/resource_folder_123/children'

# Get parent of a resource
curl -X GET 'https://api.example.com/resources/resource_doc_456/parent'

# Get all descendants (recursive)
curl -X GET 'https://api.example.com/resources/resource_folder_123/descendants'
```

## Relationship Types

Use `relationshipType` to distinguish different kinds of relationships:

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `contains` | Parent physically contains child (folder → document) |
| `references` | Parent references child (issue → linked issue) |
| `owns` | Parent owns child (user → created documents) |
| `depends-on` | Parent depends on child (task → blocking task) |

```bash
# Different relationship types
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/resource-hierarchy/batch' \
  -d '[
    {"parentResourceId": "folder_1", "childResourceId": "doc_1", "relationshipType": "contains"},
    {"parentResourceId": "issue_1", "childResourceId": "issue_2", "relationshipType": "references"},
    {"parentResourceId": "task_1", "childResourceId": "task_2", "relationshipType": "depends-on"}
  ]'
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Define type hierarchies first">
    Always define resource type hierarchies before creating resource instance hierarchies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use meaningful relationship types">
    Choose relationship types that reflect your domain model.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Avoid deep nesting">
    Very deep hierarchies can impact query performance. Consider flattening when possible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider permission implications">
    Plan how permissions will propagate through your hierarchy before building it.

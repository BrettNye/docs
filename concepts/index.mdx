## Overview

Bedrock is an authorization engine built around a few core primitives that compose together to create flexible, hierarchical access control. Understanding these concepts is essential before diving into implementation.

## The Bedrock Model

At its core, Bedrock answers one question:

> **Can this subject perform this action on this resource in this scope?**

To answer this, Bedrock evaluates:

1. **Subject** — Who is making the request? (user, agent, service)
2. **Scope** — Where in the hierarchy is this happening?
3. **Role** — What roles does the subject have in this scope?
4. **Permission** — Do any of those roles grant the requested action?
5. **Conditions** — Do any conditional rules (tags, metadata) apply?

```
Subject ──membership──▶ Scope
                          │
                          ▼
                        Role ──has──▶ Permission
                                          │
                                          ▼
                                    Action on Resource
```

## Key Relationships

| Relationship | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Subject → Scope** | A subject joins a scope via a **Membership** |
| **Membership → Role** | A membership is assigned one or more **Roles** via **Role Assignments** |
| **Role → Permission** | A role contains one or more **Permissions** via **Role Permissions** |
| **Scope → Scope** | Scopes form a hierarchy via **Scope Hierarchy Edges** |
| **Scope Type → Scope Type** | Scope types define valid parent-child relationships |

## Permission Inheritance

Permissions flow down the scope hierarchy:

```
Organization (defines: Admin, Editor, Viewer roles)
    │
    ├── Team A (inherits roles, can override)
    │       │
    │       └── Project X (inherits from Team A)
    │
    └── Team B (inherits roles, can override)
            │
            └── Project Y (inherits from Team B)
```

A subject with the "Editor" role at the Organization level has Editor permissions in all child scopes—unless an **override** modifies that behavior.

## Overrides

Bedrock supports three types of overrides to fine-tune inherited permissions:

| Override Type | What it Controls |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Role Override** | Enable/disable an entire role at a child scope |
| **Permission Override** | Enable/disable a specific permission at a child scope |
| **Role-Permission Override** | Enable/disable a specific permission for a specific role |

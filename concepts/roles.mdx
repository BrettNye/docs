## What is a Role?

A **role** is a named collection of permissions. Instead of assigning individual permissions to each subject, you create roles like "Editor" or "Admin" and assign those roles to subjects via their memberships.

## Role Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Unique identifier |
| `name` | `string` | Human-readable name (e.g., "Editor", "Admin") |
| `description` | `string?` | What this role is for |
| `scopeId` | `string` | The scope where this role is defined |

## Creating Roles

Roles are defined at a specific scope and can be used in that scope and all its descendants:

```bash
# Create an Editor role at the organization level
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/roles' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Editor",
    "description": "Can read and write documents",
    "scopeId": "scope_acme"
  }'
```

## Role Permissions

A role is just a container—it has no permissions until you add them. Use **role permissions** to connect roles to permissions:

```bash
# First, create permissions
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/permissions/batch' \
  -d '[
    {"id": "perm_read", "scopeId": "scope_acme", "action": "read", "resourceType": "document", "resourcePattern": "*", "key": "document:read:*"},
    {"id": "perm_write", "scopeId": "scope_acme", "action": "write", "resourceType": "document", "resourcePattern": "*", "key": "document:write:*"}
  ]'

# Then, add permissions to the role
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/role-permissions/batch' \
  -d '[
    {"roleId": "role_editor", "permissionId": "perm_read"},
    {"roleId": "role_editor", "permissionId": "perm_write"}
  ]'
```

## Role Assignments

To grant a role to a subject, create a **role assignment** that links the role to a membership:

```bash
# Subject must have a membership first
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/memberships' \
  -d '{"id": "membership_jane", "subjectId": "subject_jane", "scopeId": "scope_engineering"}'

# Then assign the role to the membership
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/role-assignments' \
  -d '{"roleId": "role_editor", "membershipId": "membership_jane"}'
```

## Role Inheritance

Roles defined at a parent scope are available in all child scopes:

```
Organization (defines: Admin, Editor, Viewer)
    │
    ├── Team A ─── can use Admin, Editor, Viewer
    │   │
    │   └── Project X ─── can use Admin, Editor, Viewer
    │
    └── Team B ─── can use Admin, Editor, Viewer
```

A subject with "Editor" at the Organization level has Editor permissions everywhere in that organization.

## Scope-Specific Roles

You can also define roles at child scopes for more specific use cases:

```bash
# Organization-wide roles
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/roles' \
  -d '{"name": "Editor", "scopeId": "scope_acme"}'

# Team-specific role
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/roles' \
  -d '{"name": "Sprint Manager", "scopeId": "scope_engineering"}'

# Project-specific role
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/roles' \
  -d '{"name": "Release Approver", "scopeId": "scope_backend"}'
```

## Common Role Patterns

### Standard RBAC Roles

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/roles/batch' \
  -d '[
    {"name": "Admin", "description": "Full access", "scopeId": "scope_org"},
    {"name": "Editor", "description": "Read and write", "scopeId": "scope_org"},
    {"name": "Viewer", "description": "Read only", "scopeId": "scope_org"}
  ]'
```

### Agent-Specific Roles

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/roles/batch' \
  -d '[
    {"name": "Agent Reader", "description": "AI agent with read access", "scopeId": "scope_org"},
    {"name": "Agent Writer", "description": "AI agent with write access", "scopeId": "scope_org"},
    {"name": "Agent Executor", "description": "AI agent that can execute code", "scopeId": "scope_org"}
  ]'
```

### Functional Roles

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/roles/batch' \
  -d '[
    {"name": "Billing Manager", "description": "Manage billing and invoices", "scopeId": "scope_org"},
    {"name": "User Manager", "description": "Manage team members", "scopeId": "scope_org"},
    {"name": "Auditor", "description": "View audit logs", "scopeId": "scope_org"}
  ]'
```

## Role Overrides

You can disable a role at a child scope using **role overrides**:

```bash
# Disable Admin role in production
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/scope-overrides/roles' \
  -d '{
    "childScopeId": "scope_production",
    "roleId": "role_admin",
    "state": "disabled"
  }'
```

Now subjects with the Admin role won't have admin access in production, even if they have it at the organization level.

## Multiple Roles per Membership

A membership can have multiple roles:

```bash
# Jane has both Editor and Billing Manager roles
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/role-assignments/batch' \
  -d '[
    {"roleId": "role_editor", "membershipId": "membership_jane"},
    {"roleId": "role_billing_manager", "membershipId": "membership_jane"}
  ]'
```

The subject's effective permissions are the **union** of all their roles' permissions.

## Viewing Role Permissions

```bash
# Get all permissions for a role
curl -X GET 'https://api.example.com/role-permissions?roleId=role_editor'
```

## Viewing Role Assignments

```bash
# Get all role assignments for a membership
curl -X GET 'https://api.example.com/role-assignments?membershipId=membership_jane'

# Get all role assignments for a role
curl -X GET 'https://api.example.com/role-assignments?roleId=role_editor'
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep roles focused">
    Create roles for specific purposes rather than catch-all roles. "Billing Manager" is better than "Manager".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Define roles at the right level">
    Organization-wide roles at the org level, team-specific roles at the team level.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names">
    "Document Editor" is clearer than "Editor" if you have multiple resource types.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document role purposes">
    Use the `description` field to explain what each role is for.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prefer roles over direct permissions">
    Always assign permissions via roles, not directly to subjects.
  </Accordion>

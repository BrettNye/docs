## What is Bedrock?

Bedrock is a comprehensive authorization and access control system designed to govern **both humans and AI agents** within your organization. As AI agents become integral to workflows, Bedrock provides the infrastructure to manage their permissions alongside traditional users.

## Why Bedrock for AI Agents?

As organizations deploy AI agents (LLM-powered assistants, autonomous workflows, MCP servers), they face new challenges:

- **What can this agent access?** — Agents need scoped permissions just like users
- **Can I trust this agent in this context?** — Different scopes may require different agent capabilities
- **How do I audit agent actions?** — Unified subject model enables consistent logging
- **How do I revoke agent access?** — Same mechanisms as revoking user access

Bedrock treats agents as first-class subjects, enabling you to:

1. Register agents with the `agent` subject type
2. Add agents to scopes via memberships
3. Assign roles with specific permissions
4. Override permissions at child scopes as needed

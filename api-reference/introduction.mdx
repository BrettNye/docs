## Welcome

The Bedrock API provides a comprehensive authorization and access control system. It enables you to manage subjects (users, API keys, services, agents), scopes (organizational hierarchies), roles, permissions, resources, tags, and fine-grained access control through overrides.

## ID Format

All entity IDs use a **namespaced UUIDv7** format for easy identification and sorting:

```
{namespace}_{uuidv7}
```

| Namespace | Entity |
|-----------|--------|
| `subject` | Subjects (users, agents, etc.) |
| `scope` | Scopes |
| `scope_type` | Scope Types |
| `role` | Roles |
| `permission` | Permissions |
| `resource` | Resources |
| `resource_type` | Resource Types |
| `tag` | Tags |
| `tag_group` | Tag Groups |

<Tip>
  You can provide your own IDs when creating entities. This is useful for batch operations where you need to reference entities within the same request.
</Tip>

## Core Concepts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Subjects" icon="user" href="/api-reference/subjects/get-subject">
    Users, API keys, services, or agents that can be granted access
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scopes" icon="sitemap" href="/api-reference/scopes/get-scope">
    Hierarchical organizational units (orgs, teams, projects)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Roles" icon="user-shield" href="/api-reference/roles/get-role">
    Named collections of permissions assignable to memberships
  </Card>
  <Card title="Permissions" icon="key" href="/api-reference/permissions/get-permission">
    Granular access rights (e.g., read:documents, write:documents)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resources" icon="file" href="/api-reference/resources/create-resource">
    Protected objects with types and hierarchies
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tags" icon="tag" href="/api-reference/tags/create-tag">
    Flexible metadata and categorization
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

1. **Subjects** are added to **Scopes** via **Memberships**
2. **Roles** are assigned to **Memberships** via **Role Assignments**
3. **Permissions** are assigned to **Roles** via **Role Permissions**
4. **Resources** are created within **Scopes** with **Resource Types**
5. **Tags** can be applied to resources, subjects, and other entities
6. **Scope Overrides** allow fine-tuning inherited roles/permissions at child scopes

## Batch Operations

Most create endpoints support batch operations via a `/batch` suffix. Batch requests:

- Accept an array of objects
- Support client-provided IDs for in-batch references
- Validate ID uniqueness within the batch
- Return an array of created entities

```bash
# Example: Create multiple scopes in one request
curl -X POST 'https://api.example.com/scopes/batch' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[
    {"id": "scope_org", "typeId": "scope_type_org", "name": "Acme"},
    {"id": "scope_team", "typeId": "scope_type_team", "name": "Engineering"}
  ]'
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require Bearer token authentication.

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.example.com/subjects/sub_123' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
```

## Base URL

```
https://api.example.com
```

## API Groups

### Core Authorization

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Subjects** | Manage users, API keys, services, and agents |
| **Memberships** | Add/remove subjects from scopes |
| **Roles** | Define roles within scopes |
| **Role Assignments** | Assign roles to memberships |
| **Permissions** | Define permissions within scopes |
| **Role Permissions** | Map permissions to roles |
| **Scopes** | Manage organizational hierarchy nodes |
| **Scope Types** | Define types of scopes (org, team, project) |
| **Scope Hierarchy** | Manage parent-child scope relationships |
| **Scope Type Hierarchy** | Define valid type relationships |
| **Scope Overrides** | Override inherited roles/permissions at child scopes |
| **Resource Types** | Define categories of protected resources |
| **Resources** | Manage protected objects within scopes |

### Tags & Classification

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Tag Groups** | Define categories of tags |
| **Tags** | Create tags within groups |
| **Tag Bindings** | Control which models can use which tag groups |
| **Tag Assignments** | Assign tags to resources, subjects, etc. |

### Management Models (Bedrock Cloud)

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Tenants** | Customer accounts with billing and limits |
| **Workspaces** | Logical groupings within tenants |
| **Projects** | Applications or services within workspaces |
| **Environments** | Deployment stages (prod, staging, dev) |
| **Users** | Human users with IDP integration |
| **API Keys** | Programmatic access credentials |

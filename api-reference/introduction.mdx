## Welcome

The Bedrock API provides a comprehensive authorization and access control system. It enables you to manage subjects (users, API keys, services, agents), scopes (organizational hierarchies), roles, permissions, and fine-grained access control through overrides.

## Core Concepts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Subjects" icon="user" href="/api-reference/subjects/get-subject">
    Users, API keys, services, or agents that can be granted access
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scopes" icon="sitemap" href="/api-reference/scopes/get-scope">
    Hierarchical organizational units (orgs, teams, projects)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Roles" icon="user-shield" href="/api-reference/roles/get-role">
    Named collections of permissions assignable to memberships
  </Card>
  <Card title="Permissions" icon="key" href="/api-reference/permissions/get-permission">
    Granular access rights (e.g., read:documents, write:documents)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

1. **Subjects** are added to **Scopes** via **Memberships**
2. **Roles** are assigned to **Memberships** via **Role Assignments**
3. **Permissions** are assigned to **Roles** via **Role Permissions**
4. **Scope Overrides** allow fine-tuning inherited roles/permissions at child scopes

## Authentication

All API endpoints require Bearer token authentication.

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.example.com/subjects/sub_123' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
```

## Base URL

```
https://api.example.com
```

## API Groups

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Subjects** | Manage users, API keys, services, and agents |
| **Memberships** | Add/remove subjects from scopes |
| **Roles** | Define roles within scopes |
| **Role Assignments** | Assign roles to memberships |
| **Permissions** | Define permissions within scopes |
| **Role Permissions** | Map permissions to roles |
| **Scopes** | Manage organizational hierarchy nodes |
| **Scope Types** | Define types of scopes (org, team, project) |
| **Scope Hierarchy** | Manage parent-child scope relationships |
| **Scope Type Hierarchy** | Define valid type relationships |
| **Scope Overrides** | Override inherited roles/permissions at child scopes |
